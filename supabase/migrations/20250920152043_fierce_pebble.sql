  # Create profiles table for user profile data

  1. New Tables
    - `profiles`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key, references auth.users)
      - `full_name` (text)
      - `avatar_url` (text, nullable)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `profiles` table
    - Add policies for users to read and update their own profile
